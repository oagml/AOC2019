"""
This is an orchard tree problem. Some ideas to solve this puzzle:
    Use a matrix to store the positions of asteroids and empty spaces
    Linear algebra could be useful
    Move the origin to each asteroid to analyze that position
"""
#Import the data and convert into a matrix

data = open('inputdata.txt', 'r').read().splitlines()

print(data)

#xlength = len(data[0]) #Get the length of one line (All lines have the same length)
#ylength = len(data) #Get the length of the list

#Once you have the matrix loop through every position in the matrix and analyse how many asteroids
#they can see


#Determine the asteroid with the highest number of visible asteroids
